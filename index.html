            <img src="images/pets/cheeto_cattree.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.</p>
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged. </p>

            <img src="images/pets/biscuit1.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for occasional swims.</p>
            <p>As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.</p>

            <h2>Bear</h2>

            <img src="images/pets/bear.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <p>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home.</p>

            <h2>Finn</h2>

            <img src="images/pets/Finn_Halloween.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic.</p>
            <p>Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it’s because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.</p>

            <h2>Bo</h2>

            <img src="images/pets/bo.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog with black and white fur. His paws are white too, so they always get dirty when outside. He is 12 years old, but he still likes to run around outside a lot.</p>
            <p>He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.</p>

            <img src="images/pets/oreo_sitting.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Oreo is a 20 pound pug terrier who is 6 years old. He loves following people around and always wants attention from anyone. He will play with any dog toys, especially the ones that you take from him. He likes going out on walks anytime of the day except when it is thunder storming, he will be running around the house trying to find a place to hide.</p>
            <p>After every walk, Oreo will always get the zoomies, or he will want to play fetch. He has a set schedule everyday where he likes to eat early morning around 9am and at night at 7pm. Oreo is a very high maintenance dog who needs a lot of attention but will give you all the love and kisses.</p>

            <h2>Cooky</h2>

            <img src="images/pets/cookysmiley.jpeg" alt="image 1" width="400" />
            <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.</p>
            <p>He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.</p>
